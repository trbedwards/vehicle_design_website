Having participated in eco-related engineering projects (such as Green Wave Project by Sembcorp) in the past, I am a firm believer of using engineering to making the world a better place without causing harm to Mother Nature. Currently leading the Aero/Structures Team for Imperial Vehicle Designâ€™s Shell Eco-Marathon Project, I believe as a team we are able to come out with the best design to improve fuel efficiency and make travelling by car greener.

I'm currently in 2nd year Mech Eng, hence my interest in joining this car-building project. To instill your trust in me as System's Leader , allow me to elaborate on my experiences with engineering projects. During my summer internship last year, I was involved in 2 different hospital construction projects. I also own a personal start-up with some friends to play around with android software. Along with that, I have had multiple leadership roles in Rotaract, Model United Nation's Club, Student Council and Debating Society during my college years. I hope that I can utilise my experiences and skills learnt from these experiences to create the best and funnest working experience for you guys. So join my system's team if you're looking for a fun and interesting way to develop your professional profile as an engineer!"
