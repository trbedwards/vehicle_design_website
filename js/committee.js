        "bio": "Hello everyone! My name is Sebastian Reymert and I am the chair of the Vehicle Design Society. It was a love for all vehicles, be it planes, boats, cars or anything in between that drove me to create the society. The idea slowly developed during my first year as a student of Aeronautics. With the aid of those that sit on the committee today it has now become a part of the Imperial College Union and it is my goal to make the organisation the go-to for any and all interested in design projects."

I am a fourth year mechanical engineer and have always had a strong interest in cars and motorcycles, particularly their mechanical design. As sponsorship officer I am responsible for finding and approaching suitable companies to secure funding for both the society itself and its specific projects. I am involved in similar projects within my department and would really like to see more student led vehicle design projects with involvement from students across departments."

I'm a second year aeronautics student and I helped set up the club last year in an effort to not only do something reasonably useful but also, in specific regard to the eco marathon, to do something useful with a car. I'm mainly interested in the car racing side of things but will obviously endeavour to keep all vehicle design projects running smoothly."

I am Head of Manufacturing in Vehicle Designs, therefore will be working on the production of Cube-sat and Eco-Marathon. I am looking forward to the use of industrial machining such as drilling, milling during the manufacturing phase along with the modelling phase through the use of Solidworks and Creo to create the back-bone structure for both projects. I am so confident that we are, as a Vehicle Design Unit, able to produce to high quality, competitive, fit for purpose products. Join the quest and work as a unit to succeed with end products in the summer of 2015. I look forward to meeting you guys."
