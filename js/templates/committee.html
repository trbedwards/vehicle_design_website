                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Sebastian Reymert and I am the chair of the Vehicle Design Society. It was a love for all vehicles, be it planes, boats, cars or anything in between that drove me to create the society. The idea slowly developed during my first year as a student of Aeronautics. With the aid of those that sit on the committee today it has now become a part of the Imperial College Union and it is my goal to make the organisation the go-to for any and all interested in design projects.</p>

David Cava and me are the co-leaders of the systems group. We are responsible for the "guts" of the cubesat: communications, payload, ACDS, power supply, thermal control. I am really excited by the idea of sending our own satellite into low earth orbit!!! (who wouldn't be?). There is a huge amount of new things to learn and in collaboration with all the team members we will do our best to make this happen!!!</p>

I am very excited about this project because it will give me and everyone who is involved the chance to explore the mysterious and fantastic world of space! In particular being in the F&amp;L team will give us the opportunity to deal with all aspects of the design and engineering process and we will also be in contact with industries and companies. A little bit more about me, I can tell you I am a big tennis fan and I always seek for people to play with, so I am looking forward to meet all of you outside whether for Cubesat or for tennis!</p>

                    <p>Hi I’m Danielle and am in 2nd year Aeronautics. My main motivation for being involved in the CubeSat project is my aspiration to contribute to space exploration. When I heard that we were doing a student run project that was actually going to put a satellite in space, I had to sign up.  I am the Structures Team Leader on the project and am really excited about being in charge of this team – we are going to be the people who get to design the majority of the CubeSat! I am currently PR officer for ICSEDS (Imperial College Students for the Exploration and Development of Space), where we build High Powered Rockets, do High Altitude Ballooning and also have a rocket engine design project. I went with the society to the National Student Space conference last year, which had loads of really cool talks on nearly everything you can imagine that is going on in the Space Industry. Who knows – our CubeSat may be able to feature in one of those talks once its up and orbiting. To give just a little bit more information in what I do at university; I’m in the orchestra, play in a folk band, and do some yoga and latin dancing on the side.  This project is a lot more technical and also quite different to anything I’ve done before so I am really looking forward to the challenge.</p>

                    <p>As an individual, I love engineering and how stuff works generally and have even once nearly burned down my room by experimenting with a toaster! Having participated in eco-related engineering projects (such as Green Wave Project by Sembcorp) in the past, I am a firm believer of using engineering to making the world a better place without causing harm to Mother Nature. Currently leading the Aero/Structures Team for Imperial Vehicle Design’s Shell Eco-Marathon Project, I believe as a team we are able to come out with the best design to improve fuel efficiency and make travelling by car greener.

I am Head of Manufacturing in Vehicle Designs, therefore will be working on the production of Cube-sat and Eco-Marathon. I am looking forward to the use of industrial machining such as drilling, milling during the manufacturing phase along with the modelling phase through the use of Solidworks and Creo to create the back-bone structure for both projects. I am so confident that we are, as a Vehicle Design Unit, able to produce to high quality, competitive, fit for purpose products. Join the quest and work as a unit to succeed with end products in the summer of 2015. I look forward to meeting you guys.</p>

I'm currently in 2nd year Mech Eng, hence my interest in joining this car-building project. To instill your trust in me as System's Leader , allow me to elaborate on my experiences with engineering projects. During my summer internship last year, I was involved in 2 different hospital construction projects. I also own a personal start-up with some friends to play around with android software. Along with that, I have had multiple leadership roles in Rotaract, Model United Nation's Club, Student Council and Debating Society during my college years. I hope that I can utilise my experiences and skills learnt from these experiences to create the best and funnest working experience for you guys. So join my system's team if you're looking for a fun and interesting way to develop your professional profile as an engineer!</p>
